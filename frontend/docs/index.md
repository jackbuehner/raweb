## Using RAWeb

By default, RAWeb is available at https://127.0.0.1/RAWeb. To access RAWeb from other computers on your local network, replace 127.0.0.1 with your host PC or server's name. To access RAWeb from outside your local network, expose port 443 and replace 127.0.0.1 with your public IP address.

To add resources to the RAWeb interface, [refer to Publishing RemoteApps and Desktops](/docs/publish-resources).

Refer to the guides in this wiki's sidebar for more information about using RAWeb.

[^footnote-2016]: If you are attempting to install RAWeb on Windows Server 2016, you may need to enable TLS 1.2. In PowerShell, run `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`.

<script setup>
   import {InfoBar} from '$components';
</script>
